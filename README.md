# My Portfolio

As the title states this is a test portfolio just using HTML CSS and Vanilla JS. 
I wanted to use REACT but I wasn't comfortable with it so instead I punished myself 
by replicating some gadgets through just using display flex to the best of my abilities.


Update 1: 
It isn't finished as I haven't compressed the files for optimized loads.

I did enjoy using scrolls snap type but for now I just want to see how it loads.

Update 2:
Added most of what's needed. Probably. Quite tiring so I just want to sleep for now.
